##Web3Ladies-Team-Stark
##For our Web3ladies final project, We were asked to build an NFT gated social board.

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for checking out our Project.

The challenge
An NFT gated social board
A user should be able to make posts and specify the contract address/addresses of the NFT that will be used for the gating.
Only users with an NFT/NFTs should be able to view posts based on the NFTs the author specified.
An interface that would show posts to users depending on if they hold an NFT. Example: If you hold a Bored Ape NFT you should be able to view a post
